# bidaf-keras
Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension implemented in Keras 2

## To-do list
- Make this project as a portable module and publish it on pypi

I don't know which things should I keep in mind to do this (such as if a directory doesn't exists at runtime, the model should create it dynamically instead of throwing an error). If you have such points that I should keep in mind, consider contributing to this project. Also, if you have time to implement it in this project, submit your work with a pull request on a new branch.

Thoughts, samples codes, modifications and any other type of contributions are appreciated. This is my first project in Deep Learning and also first being open source. I will need as much help as possible as I don't know the path I need to follow. Thank you..
