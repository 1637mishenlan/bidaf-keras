# bidaf-keras
Implementation of [Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01603) implemented in Keras 2

## Release-info
This project will soon be available for use by just running a pyhton file (graph.py as of now). A pretrained model will also be made available soon. My teammate is also working on building this model in tensorflow and it will also be available soon.

## What you can do with this project:
- Train/Retrain this model with your own dataset.
- Use the pretrained model for extending your own model or to try this one out.
- Modify the code of this model to develop a new model architucture out of it.

## To-do list
- Make this project as a portable module and publish it on pypi
- Generate requirements.txt

I don't know which things should I keep in mind to do this (such as if a directory doesn't exists at runtime, the model should create it dynamically instead of throwing an error). If you have such points that I should keep in mind, consider contributing to this project. Also, if you have time to implement it in this project, submit your work with a pull request on a new branch.

Thoughts, samples codes, modifications and any other type of contributions are appreciated. This is my first project in Deep Learning and also first being open source. I will need as much help as possible as I don't know the path I need to follow. Thank you..
